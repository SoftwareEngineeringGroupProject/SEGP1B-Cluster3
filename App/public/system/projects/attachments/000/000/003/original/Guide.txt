Format of the input
3 {1,2,3,4,4}

The first number is frame size (i dont know if this is right way to call it, since i have not got chance to attend in lecs for long time)
Numbers in bracket are page reference, each one of them will put into frame
For example, at the first time the frame is filled, the frame of size 3 looks like this:
	1
	2
	3

Psuedo code for LRU Algorithm:

( consider page as integer. If you want to use page as an object of a class then make sure use it properly, dont use it randomly as an normal integer. )


- For each line (i.e., for a single test case ) you have to read in 

	- Size of frame ( create an linkedlist for this frame, use a variable to keep track of its size to determine it is full or not)

	- Elements in bracket as an linkedlist 

	( make sure you have right data in your linkedlist before proceeding, just system out to see if it is right or wrong)

Add(int page) {

	if frame contains page {

		- remove page from frame
		- add that page again to the head of the frame

		if (frame is full) { // mentioned in specification
			- number of References ++ 
		}
			
	else {
		
		if frame is not full {
			- add page to the head of the frame
		} else {
			- add page to the head of the frame
			- remove the last element from the frame => the replaced page is this last page
			- page fault ++
			- number of references ++
		}

	}
